"""SFMTA bikeway network, conflated onto the street graph, and the bike
"stress" multiplier the route page uses to prefer calm streets.

The SFMTA Bike Network (DataSF, ``MTA_Bike_Network_Linear_Features``) is a
set of centreline segments keyed by CNN, which Overture does not carry, so
the match is geometric: an edge takes a facility when at least half of the
points sampled along it lie within ``MATCH_M`` of an SFMTA segment that runs
roughly parallel to it.  Where several facilities match, the most protected
one wins.

Facility classes (SFMTA): I = off-street path, II = painted lane (possibly
buffered), III = signed route / sharrows, IV = separated bikeway.
``NEIGHBORWAY`` is a traffic-calmed class III.

The stress multiplier is in equivalent metres per metre: a block that feels
like 1.4 blocks.  It is a comfort scale, not a speed model, and it only ever
applies to the distance objective in bike mode when the rider asks for calm
streets, so the climbing axis of the frontier is untouched.
